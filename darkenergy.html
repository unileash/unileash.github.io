    <h1>Dark Energy: The Force Behind the Universe’s Expansion</h1>

    <p>Dark energy is one of the most mysterious and dominant forces in the universe. It’s invisible, unmeasurable by traditional tools, and yet it makes up nearly <strong>68% of the entire universe</strong>. What is it? No one truly knows.</p>

    <p>The idea of dark energy emerged when scientists observed that the universe isn't just expanding — it's expanding faster and faster. This discovery, awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, changed our understanding of the cosmos forever.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#00ffff;">The Discovery That Shook Cosmology</h2>
    <p>In the late 1990s, two independent teams studied supernovae (exploding stars) to measure how fast the universe was expanding. Surprisingly, the supernovae were dimmer than expected — meaning they were farther away than they should be. The universe’s expansion wasn’t slowing down. It was <em>accelerating</em>.</p>

    <p>This acceleration could only be explained by some unknown, repulsive force — and that force is what we now call <strong>dark energy</strong>.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#00ffff;">What Could Dark Energy Be?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cosmological Constant (Λ):</strong> Einstein’s idea — a fixed energy that fills space uniformly, even in a vacuum.</li>
      <li><strong>Quintessence:</strong> A dynamic, evolving field that changes over time and space — like a cosmic fluid.</li>
      <li><strong>Extra Dimensions:</strong> Some theories suggest dark energy is a result of hidden spatial dimensions influencing gravity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Despite these theories, no direct evidence tells us exactly what dark energy is. It remains a placeholder term — a label for the unknown driving the universe’s acceleration.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#00ffff;">The Fate of the Universe</h2>
    <p>If dark energy continues its influence, the universe could expand forever, galaxies drifting apart until stars burn out and only cold darkness remains. This scenario is known as the <strong>Big Freeze</strong>.</p>

    <p>In more extreme theories, dark energy could grow stronger over time, eventually ripping apart galaxies, stars, planets — even atoms — in a cataclysmic event called the <strong>Big Rip</strong>.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#00ffff;">Why Dark Energy Matters</h2>
    <p>Dark energy challenges the very foundation of physics and cosmology. It forces us to confront how little we truly know about the universe. It affects the shape, evolution, and destiny of all that exists.</p>

    <p>Future missions like the <strong>Euclid Space Telescope</strong> and <strong>NASA’s Roman Space Telescope</strong> are being built to study dark energy by mapping galaxies and measuring cosmic expansion with extreme precision.</p>

    <p>Dark energy is the ghost in the machine — the silent power stretching space itself, writing the ultimate fate of reality.</p>
